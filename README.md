welcome to better-dakota!

this is my first real development project.

here is going to be a running to-do list of features i plan to add, and then if they've been completed:

# to-do
- [ ] **daily husbando command**
  - [ ] decide if i'll pull from a website/api or use a self-made database
  - [ ] make it so a husbando can be rolled once a day (based off a to-be decided timezone)
  - [ ] make selection message ephemeral, adding an option to reveal the daily pick in the interactionCreated channel
  - [ ] include (make optional?) a tiny blurb with the character info, age, show they appear in, etc
  - [ ] decide if there will be one re-roll chance
- [ ] **daily waifu command**
  - [ ] commandeer husbando code over
- [ ] **game vote command**
  - [ ] create a database for this to pull from to store eligible games to play
  - [ ] option for a guilds mod to set the frequency of the vote, when it starts, and when it ends
  - [ ] make the vote configurable: number of categories to choose from (1-5?) and number of choices for each category (1-5?)
  - [ ] let the vote be anonymous with buttons or visible with emoji reactions (vote mode can be changed for next vote onwards)
